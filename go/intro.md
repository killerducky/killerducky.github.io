# Rough equivalence of Go ranks to Chess ranks
  * Traditional amatuer ranks start at 30-kyu and work up to 1-kyu. Then dan (black belt) ranks start from 1-dan and go up.
  * Professional players have a separate rank system 1-dan (1p) to 9-dan (9p).
  * Every server/organisation has very different difficulties for ranks
  * These assume OGS ratings. Asian servers (Fox etc) and AGA is easier, EGF harder
    * 30k-20k = Beginner
    * 19k-10k = Casual player
    * 9k-1k = Club player
    * 1d-3d = Expert
    * 4d-6d = NM
    * 7d+ = IM
    * 1p-9p = GM
