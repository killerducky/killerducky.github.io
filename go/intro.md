# Rough equivalence of Go ranks to Chess ranks

-   Traditional amatuer ranks start at 30-kyu and work up to 1-kyu. Then dan (black belt) ranks start from 1-dan and go up.
-   Professional players have a separate rank system 1-dan (1p) to 9-dan (9p).
-   Every server/organisation has very different difficulties for ranks
-   These assume OGS ratings. Asian servers (Fox etc) and AGA is easier, EGF harder
    -   30k-20k = Beginner
    -   19k-10k = Casual player
    -   9k-1k = Club player
    -   1d-3d = Expert
    -   4d-6d = NM
    -   7d+ = IM
    -   1p-9p = GM
