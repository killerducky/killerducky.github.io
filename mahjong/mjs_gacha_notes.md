# MJS Gacha notes
* Donate stuff for dust
    * Items -> Gift -> Donate
    * Select stuff to donate
        * Consider keeping Purple items for final bond ceremony (Delcious Cookie, Powerful Console, Classic Painting, Valuable Goblet, Heart of the Ocean, Teddy Bear XXL, Delicate Fanzine, Gorgeous Dress)
        * Consider keeping the minor versions of these items for characters that you are working on bonding with (See below Bonding)
            * Probably not worth keeping extras around though, just dust them
* Pay 50 dust for Summon Scroll
    * Shop -> Fortune -> Summon Scroll
* Use Summon Scroll to get characters and decorations
    * Pick Sakura Path for female characters, Bamboo Path for male characters.
    * During events rate up certain characters have higher odds (but overall odds to get any character per pull are still the same)
* Bond with your character to level up
    * Play games with the character selected
    * Give them gifts
        * Dorm -> Pick character -> View -> Gift
        * But only the type they like
            * They like the minor versions of the Purple item that is required for the final Bond ceremony
            * For example Niki requires Heart of the Ocean for the final Bond
            * So you get bonus Bond points for gifting the other diamonds
        * Save purple gifts for final ceremony
        * Other gifts should be donated for dust to get new characters
    * Get more emotes
    * Get more voice lines
* Final Bond ceremony
    * 10 Wishing Stones
        * Summon -> Faith
        * 10 Faith = 10 Wishing Stones
    * 5 Purple items
        * You remembered to save the Purple items right?
        * You can buy also, but it's very expensive
        * 25 Faith = 25 Wishing Stones = 1 Purple item
    * 100 Dust and some other stuff you should be able to get
