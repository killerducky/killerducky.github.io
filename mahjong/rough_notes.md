# Melding
* Do not meld if one of the two holds:
  * The hand is both cheap and far from ready (2-away after melding)
  * Melding significantly reduces the hand value (falls from 7700+ to 2000- = 4han to 2han)
    * These lose 1 han each from melding:
      * riichi, pinfu, SSK, double straight, pure straight
      * Incomplete SSK, double straight is often only 50/50 for the han
    * Ex: 2 dora + riichi + pinfu
* Some exceptions:
  * If you can eliminate a bad wait and make the hand ready, meld!
  * If you have a concealed set of value tiles, you can meld with a cheap and slow hand. (Because you can safely fold the 3 value tiles if needed)
* More exceptions:
  * You are ahead of the game in South-4
  * There are two or more riichi bets on the table. 
  * You are losing and you are the dealer

# Push/Fold
* Push if two of the following conditions are met:
  * Ready hand (not iishanten/1-ready!)
  * High scoring hand (7700+ = 4han+)
  * Good wait (2 kinds, 6+ tiles)
  
# Riichi
* Only dama (skipping Riichi) for: bad-wait riichi-only hand by a non-dealer.
* What to do with yaku-less hand:
  * Riichi if you make the hand ready. 
  * Don’t make it ready if you don’t riichi.
  
# Toitoi vs. chiitoitsu
* Choose chiitoitsu in the following situations.
  * There is a futile pair in your hand. (Most important reason)
  * There is no pair of value tiles in your hand. 
  * There are three or more pairs of simple tiles between 3 and 7 in your hand.

# Random examples
* XXX XXX 244 778 45 
  * cut 2 = keep the good 778 shape
* XXX 112 899 566 45
  * cut 6 = go back to 2 pairs? RB1 page 76 example is similar to this + p82 
    * Balance the two bad shapes
  * cut 5 = perfect 2-away? And the bad shapes are balanced?
* XXX 122 788 566 45
  * now we can cut 1 for perfect 2-away
  * both 788 and 566 are good shapes
  * not really "3 pairs" because we will finish one of 788 or 566 before going to 1-away
* 3 pair / 2 pair  
  * 2 pairs: keep the good shape and make a clean pair from the worst shape
  * 3 pairs: keep the pair in the bad shapes and cut the pair from the best shape

* Mid/Late Riichi: tiles around are dangerous
  * 445 cut 4, 3-6
  * 344 cut 4, 2-5
* Suji on riichi discard not reliable
  * 246 cut 6, suji 3 deals in
