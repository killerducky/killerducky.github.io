# Melding
* Do not meld if one of the two holds:
  * The hand is both cheap and far from ready (2-away after melding)
  * Melding significantly reduces the hand value (falls from 7700+ to 2000-)
* Some exceptions:
  * If you can eliminate a bad wait and make the hand ready, meld!
  * If you have a concealed set of value tiles, you can meld with a cheap and slow hand. (Because you can safely fold the 3 value tiles if needed)
* More exceptions:
  * You are ahead of the game in South-4
  * There are two or more riichi bets on the table. 
  * You are losing and you are the dealer

# Push/Fold
* Push if two of the following conditions are met:
  * Ready hand
  * High scoring hand (7700+)
  * Good wait (2 kinds, 4+ tiles)
  
# Riichi
* Only dama (skipping Riichi) for: bad-wait riichi-only hand by a non-dealer.
* What to do with yaku-less hand:
  * Riichi if you make the hand ready. 
  * Don’t make it ready if you don’t riichi.
  
# Toitoi vs. chiitoitsu
* Choose chiitoitsu in the following situations.
  * There is a futile pair in your hand. (Most important reason)
  * There is no pair of value tiles in your hand. 
  * There are three or more pairs of simple tiles between 3 and 7 in your hand.
