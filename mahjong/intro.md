# Learning Mahjong from scratch
* [Mahjong Soul](https://mahjongsoul.yo-star.com) aka MJS
  * Do the tutorial (Right side, 3rd icon = graduation cap)
  * For your first games:
    *  Try for a normal 4 groups of 3 and a pair
    *  Ignore the Chii, Pon, and Kan buttons
       *  This guarantees your hand will be able to Riichi = Yaku = qualify
    *  When the Riichi button appears, click it and the computer will recommend a discard
  * Friendly Match for more thinking time when you start
    * Create Room
    * Vs AI, 300+0s (300 seconds for every turn)
    * Create
    * Start
* Start learning more Yaku

  * Order to learn:
    * Riichi
      * You cannot call Pon/Chii
    * Yakuhai (value triplet)
      * You can consider calling Pon on a value triplet
    * Tanyao (all simples) 
      * If you have no 1s, 9s, or honors you can consider calling Pon/Chii
      * But be careful with 23 or 78 draws, if you open the hand you are committed to no 1s or 9s!
    * Chiitoitsu  (seven pairs)
      * One of two exceptions to the 4 groups of 3 and a pair pattern
      * If you end up with 5 pairs, go for this
      * Otherwise it's usually best to go for a normal 4 groups of 3 and a pair hand
      * BTW the final exception for 4 groups of 3 and a pair is:
        * Kokushi Musou (thirteen orphans) only go for this if:
          * You start the hand with 9+ terminals
          * The game will ask if you want to re-deal
          * If you feel lucky, click continue and go for it!
          * If you start with 9 terminals, your odds are about 5.5% [Source](https://osamuko.com/i-told-you-not-to-go-for-kokushi/)
    * The rest of the ones labelled "Basic"
    * The rest of the Closed Hands Only section
    * All the rest
