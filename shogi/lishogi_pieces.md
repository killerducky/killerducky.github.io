# lishogi piece sets
lishogi has many options for how the pieces look:
  * Click your username in the upper right, and Piece Set
  * The traditional sets use Japanese character (Kanji) which takes more time to get used to if you cannot read Japanese
  * There are many more beginner friently sets that make it quicker to learn how each piece moves.
    * But many resources will only use traditional sets
  * There are many types of beginner sets:
    * Use traditional Japanese Kanji, but also have hints on how they move
    * Use Western chess style pieces
    * Pieces that visually cue how the pieces move

## Beginner sets with Kanji included
* I recommend these so you naturally start to recognize the Kanji alone
  * (Important for sites that only have the Kanji)

### Shogi_cz
![](media%5Clishogi%20sets%5CShogi_cz.png)
  * \+ I recommend this set
  * \+ The bottom shows how the pieces move
  * \+ The top has traditional Kanji
  * \- Kanji and move guide share space, making both smaller

#### Kanji_Guide_Shadowed
![](media%5Clishogi_sets%5CKanji_Guide_Shadowed.png)
  * \+ Another good choice
  * \+ Move guide is small so the Kanji is larger
  * \- Move guide is small!
  * \- Uses multiple colors for different pieces

### Valdivia

  * \+ Another good choice, similar to Shogi_cz

## Beginner sets without Kanji
* Some of these are good, but the big drawback is you don't have an easy transition to traditional Kanji

### western
![](media%5Clishogi_sets%5Cwestern.png)
  * \+ Borrows Western chess for pieces that crossover
  * \+ Gold General, Silver General, and Lance designs hint how they move
  * \- No easy bridge to traditional Kanji

### Intl_Colored_3d

### Doubotsu
![](media%5Clishogi_sets%5Cdoubotsu.png)
