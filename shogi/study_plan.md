# Study Plan

## Introduction
This is a step-by-step study plan starting from complete beginner at Shogi.
There are many different ways to learn, and everyone will have different
goals and priorities. It's not important what you study or in what order.
The most important thing is to spend time playing and/or studying!

That said, there are good ways and no-so-good ways to spend your time:
* S-Tier ways to spend shogi time
    * Playing shogi!
    * Reviewing games you played
    * Solving problems
* A-Tier
    * Studying openings
    * Studying castles
    * Studying games other people play
* B-Tier
    * Talking about Shogi on Discord
    * Debating (with yourself or others) what is the best
        * Castle
        * Opening
        * Way to study
* D-Tier
    * Making tier lists (Kappa)

For some people the B-Tier things might be the most fun. It might look
like I'm discouraging you from chatting on Discord, but quite the opposite!
It's great to meet people who share your interest in Shogi, and that can help
motivate you to play more. But I encourage you to actually play Shogi,
not just talk about it!

## The Plan

### Your first three games
* Register on [Lishogi](https://lishogi.org)
* Pick your favorite piece set, for beginners I recommend shogi_cz because it has the traditional Kanji on top, 
  and a small pictogram that shows how the piece moves on the bottom. 
  You will naturally start to recognize the Kanji alone (important for sites that only have the Kanji).
* Complete the [Learn](https://lishogi.org/learn) section to learn how all the pieces move
* Play a 10-piece handicap game vs the computer 
    * From the main Lishogi page, click play with the computer
    * Variant -> From Position
    * 10-piece (Computer starts with 10 pieces missing -- only King and Pawns left)
    * Select Sente (Black King)
    * Or find an experienced human opponent, try the [Shogi Harbour Discord](https://discord.gg/wggn65v)
    * The idea is just to practice moving the pieces and understanding the rules
* Play a second game
    * If you lost, try the same handicap    
    * If you won, move up to the next handicap on the list (8-piece)
* Play a third game, continue adjusting the handicap
* Congratulations, you're starting to get an idea how the pieces move!
    * Not a small thing in such a different game, even if you're used to chess
    * Most English speakers will have a hard time even recognizing which piece is which!

### Time for some study
* Complete [KD's Beginner tsumes](https://lishogi.org/study/4XssSDlR) (checkmate problems)
* In Shogi, when you get an advantage you cannot simplify the position by trading all the pieces
    * In fact, trading pieces makes the game *more* complicated, because of the drop rule!
* The safest way to win is to checkmate them quickly
    * To do this, you're going to need to know some common checkmating techniques!
* Play 3 more handicap games

### Playing your first even game
* Complete [KD's Game concepts and tactics](https://lishogi.org/study/cgqKMj1v)
    * The first few chapters focus on Rook Pawn tactics
* Go through this [List of Castles](https://lishogi.org/study/O591ZfdK)
    * Pick one of these to try out in your first even game
* For your first even game, I recommend finding another (human) beginner
    * Lishogi is new, there are not many human opponents, you need to be proactive to get one!
    * Or ask in the [Shogi Harbour Discord](https://discord.gg/wggn65v)
    * Or go to a Lishogi arena, and ask if a beginner there wants to pause the arena and play
    * Or try 81dojo, there are more humans there
        * See the 81dojo section [here](shogi/intro)
    * As a last resort, you can play Lishogi Level 1, but even that level is quite strong!
* Play two more games!

### The long haul
* You're starting to get an idea of what Shogi is all about, congratulations!
* Keep playing games!
* Start reviewing your own games
    * One of the best ways to improve is to review your own games
    * Request computer analysis first, to get it started
    * Then start reviewing on your own without looking at the computer at first
    * Also ask your opponent to join you in the review
        * This takes a few steps on Lishogi, you have to create a study and invite your opponent
    * Think of 2 or 3 points in the game where you wonder if you made the right choice
    * Check with the computer on those points
    * Also check a few of the computer suggestions for other points
        * For the opening and middle game, focus on 2 or 3 of the places where the graph changed the most
        * For the endgame, focus on a few of the shorter checkmates that you missed
* Solve problems
    * Survival mode at [Playshogi](http://playshogi.com)
        * These start at mate in 3, but they are quite difficult!
* Lishogi studies:
    * [Tsume or Hisshi](https://lishogi.org/study/AauH6dBj) (Hisshi = Brinkmate)
    * Studies about openings
        * [Ranging Rook](https://lishogi.org/study/eo0pa339)
        * [Central Rook](https://lishogi.org/study/8L2ZWmEy)
        * [Bishop Exchange Rightside King](https://lishogi.org/study/1aG4uoEP)
        * [Wrong Diagonal Bishop](https://lishogi.org/study/A7danIVZ)
* Start watching Shuji Muranakaâ€™s [commented Shogi Wars games](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi002ZNuMn65AZlsQJNnl4MVm_gjh4DV_), with English subtitles (turn on CC!)
    * A great resource to quickly get exposure to a wide variety of openings
    * He covers the main points in the game
    * The level is above an absolute beginner, if you have questions, ask in Discord!

### Connecting with the Shogi community
* Join the [Shogi Harbour Discord](https://discord.gg/wggn65v)!
    * There are many people willing to help, but they will be more willing if you show
      you're motivated to put in the effort on your own.
    * Ultimately you need to do the work on your own to understand Shogi
* Join the weekly shogi ladder in the Discord, see #shogi-ladder-rules
* Join the next "Tourny To" series, see #tt-series-rules
* Join some of the many Arena tournaments on Lishogi
    * Right now there are few players, so these can be hard for beginners
    * You will probably be matched with many strong opponents
    * You can also try asking some of the other beginners if they want to bail on the Arena and just play your own games!
